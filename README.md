# Phoenix Alerts
- Alerts you when a party member is ressurecting with a Phoenix passive or with an Eren's Key.
- If your class is not a healer, it only alerts you when the healer is resurrecting with phoenix/key.
- If your class is a healer, it alerts you for everyone.

# Configuration
- `enabled`: `true` if you want the mod enabled on startup. `false` otherwise
- `everyone`: `true` if you want the mod to alert you about everyone, regardless of your class.
- - Only meaningful when you are not a Healer.
- `debug`: `true` if you want debug messages. `false` otherwise
- `dungeon`: `true` if you only want it to work when you're inside a dungeon.
