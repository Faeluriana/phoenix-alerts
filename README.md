# Phoenix Alerts
- Alerts you with a fake party message when a party member is resurrecting with a Phoenix passive or with an Eren's Key
- Only you will be able to see this message
- If your class is not a healer, it only alerts you when the healer is resurrecting with phoenix/key
- If your class is a healer, it alerts you for everyone

## Configuration
- `enabled`: `true` if you want the mod enabled on startup. `false` otherwise
- `everyone`: `true` if you want the mod to alert you about everyone, regardless of your class
- - Only meaningful when you are not a Healer
- `debug`: `true` if you want debug messages
- `dungeon`: `true` if you only want it to work when you're inside a dungeon
- `language`: `en` for English language

## Translations
- If you wish to help translate to your language i'd appreciate it! It's only a few words so it should be very easy. Some current translations might be wrong... >.<

## Special Thanks
